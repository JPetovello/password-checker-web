# Password Checker Web

A lightweight, secure web application for evaluating password strength, calculating entropy, checking against known data breaches via the Have I Been Pwned API, and generating secure passphrases. Built with Flask, Python, and Tailwind CSS, featuring local k-Anonymity privacy protection.

## Features

* **Password Strength Evaluation:** Powered by zxcvbn for robust, pattern-based strength checks with detailed cracking scenario breakdowns.
* **Breach Detection:** Checks passwords securely using the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) API via k-Anonymity (only the first 5 characters of the SHA-1 hash are sent).
* **Entropy Calculation:** Real-time mathematical entropy calculation based on character set size and length.
* **Secure Passphrase Generator:** Generates memorable, high-entropy passphrases using the EFF Large Wordlist with custom separators and batch options.
* **Progressive Web App (PWA) Support:** Installable directly to mobile or desktop home screens with offline static asset caching via service worker.
* **Dark Mode & System Theme Sync:** Automatically detects system color preferences with manual toggle override and `localStorage` persistence.
* **Privacy-First:** No passwords ever leave your instance unhashed, and telemetry can be opted out.

## Installation

### Standard Docker / Docker Desktop

Run the container using Docker CLI:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name password-checker-web \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -e APP_SOURCE="docker_standalone" \
  hardly007/password-checker-web:latest
```

### Unraid (Community Applications)

Search for Password Checker Web in the Unraid Community Applications tab and install it directly using the official template. The deployment source will automatically register as unraid_ca.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PORT` | `5000` | Port the internal Gunicorn / Flask web server listens on. |
| `APP_SOURCE` | `docker_standalone` | Identifies where the container was deployed (e.g., `unraid_ca`). |
| `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` | `false` | Set to `true` to opt out of anonymous startup telemetry. |
| `REDIS_URL` | *(blank)* | Full Redis connection URI (e.g., `redis://:secret@192.168.1.50:6379/0`). Overrides individual host/port variables when populated. |
| `REDIS_HOST` | `localhost` | Redis host or IP address. Used when `REDIS_URL` is empty or omitted. |
| `REDIS_PORT` | `6379` | Redis port number. Used when `REDIS_URL` is empty or omitted. |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | *(blank)* | Optional Redis authentication password (for host/port configuration). |
| `REDIS_DB` | `0` | Redis database index. |

### Redis Connection Resolution Logic

The application establishes its cache and rate-limiting store using a tiered fallback strategy:

1. **Explicit URL (`REDIS_URL`)**: Checked first. If present and non-empty, the app connects directly via this URI.
2. **Host & Port Fallback (`REDIS_HOST` / `REDIS_PORT`)**: If `REDIS_URL` is an empty string (`""`) or unset, the app builds a connection string formatted as `redis://:[PASSWORD]@[HOST]:[PORT]/[DB]`.
3. **In-Memory Emergency Fallback (`memory://`)**: If Redis is completely unavailable or unconfigured, Flask-Limiter gracefully degrades to in-memory tracking so the web application remains fully operational.
